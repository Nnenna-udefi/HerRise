        "At HerRise Foundation, we are committed to breaking that silence. Through our “Voices Against VAWG” project, supported by the Nigerian Women’s Trust Fund, we’ve been traveling into communities not just to hold events—but to ignite conversations.",
        "One of these conversations recently took place at Brain Prosper International School in Mile 50, Abakaliki, Ebonyi State. There, we engaged with educators—not just as professionals, but as community influencers, parents, and protectors. The staff didn’t just listen—they leaned in. They asked questions, shared concerns, and reminded us why these spaces matter so deeply.",

        "Not because the girls don’t want justice—but because they don’t believe they’ll be heard. Because somewhere along the line, society taught them that their pain was too inconvenient, too shameful, too small to matter.",
        "This has to change. And it can. So what now?",
        "We keep talking. We keep teaching. We keep showing up—in schools, in homes, in policy rooms, and on the streets. Because silence will never protect our daughters. And awareness without action is just noise.",
        "When a community understands the cost of inaction, it begins to move differently. Teachers start to notice. Parents start to ask questions. Boys begin to unlearn. Girls begin to speak.",
        "This is the slow, steady work of change—and it starts with awareness.",

        "With sincerity and strength, HRH Gabriel Ngele pledged his full support to the cause. But he didn’t stop there. In a striking display of inclusion, he revealed that four women serve in his royal cabinet—and invited them to join the discussion immediately. Right there, in the palace, the conversation expanded to include women who are often unheard in spaces of power.",
        "That moment was more than symbolic. It was transformational.",
        "Because when leaders speak up, people listen. When men join the conversation, the narrative begins to shift. And when communities come together, cycles of silence begin to break.",
        "At HerRise, we believe that real change begins at the grassroots—with honest conversations, bold leadership, and communities that refuse to look the other way. It’s not just about events or projects. It’s about voices—rising, again and again, until violence against women and girls is no longer normalized or ignored.",
