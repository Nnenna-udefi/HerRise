        "For some, it's a distant issue — something they read about, hear about, or contribute to once in a while. But for us at HerRise Foundation, it's deeply personal. Because long before we began championing menstrual equity, we lived the very realities we now fight to change.",
        "We weren’t just donating 480 sanitary pads. We were standing in the gap for every girl who has ever used tissue, rags, or old cloths because pads were a luxury. We were showing up for the girl who missed school every month because she feared the shame of being stained, mocked, or embarrassed. We were fighting for the girl we once were.",
        "This year, through our Pad Up the Girl Child 2025 initiative, we reached hundreds of girls across underserved communities—providing not just 480 sanitary pads, but restoring dignity, safeguarding education, and rekindling confidence.",
        "Because no girl should ever have to choose between her period and her future. We’ve sat with girls whose eyes held the silent shame of their first menstruation. We’ve heard the stories of missed classes, lost confidence, and dreams pushed aside simply because something natural was treated like a curse.",
        "But now, we’re seeing something different.",

        "We’re seeing smiles instead of shame. Confidence replacing fear. Full classrooms instead of absentee lists.",

        "Every pad we handed out carried a message: You matter. Your dignity matters. Your education matters.",

        "This is what impact from lived experience looks like. This is why we do what we do.",

        "We're still reminiscing on the joy that filled the air during that outreach—the giggles, the tight hugs, the questions asked boldly during our menstrual health sessions. The kind of joy that doesn't fade. And as we look ahead, our mission remains unchanged: to ensure that no girl is left behind because of something as natural as her period.",

        "Violence against women and girls isn’t just a private matter—it’s a cultural wound. One that festers in silence, in complicity, in the casual acceptance of harmful norms passed down like family heirlooms. But what if communities could unlearn that silence? What if the men entrusted with tradition chose, instead, to protect?",
        "At HerRise Foundation, we believe they can. And we saw it firsthand in Oriuzor Autonomous Community, Ebonyi State, Nigeria.",
        "With support from the Nigerian Women Trust Fund, we gathered not just to speak, but to stir something deeper—to ignite the conversations that challenge old beliefs and awaken new responsibilities. We brought together community leaders and men to talk about violence against women and girls not as a women’s issue, but as a communal betrayal that demands communal healing.",
        "It wasn’t easy. These are conversations steeped in generations of silence. But slowly, we saw change flicker in the room—in the way questions were asked, in the way listening deepened, in the way heads began to nod in recognition that this, too, is their fight.",
        "Because change doesn’t begin in policies or hashtags. It begins when a father decides his daughter’s safety matters. When a chief invites women into his council. When a boy grows up seeing a man say, “Not in my house. Not in my community.”",

Oriuzor Village in Ezza North LGA, Ebonyi State, has known such silence. But something remarkable happened when HerRise Foundation visited this resilient community. That silence cracked—and voices rose.",
        "Backed by the Voices Against VAWG project with support from the Nigerian Women Trust Fund, our mission was clear: to bring the conversation about Gender-Based Violence (GBV) to the heart of rural communities, starting with honest, human dialogue.",
        "The numbers are staggering. Globally, one in every three women has experienced physical or sexual violence in her lifetime—most often from someone she knows. Here in Nigeria, the 2018 National Demographic and Health Survey revealed that 30% of women aged 15–49 have experienced physical violence. Yet behind these statistics lie deeper truths—unreported cases, systemic silence, and a cultural web that often traps women in cycles of abuse with nowhere to turn.",
        "Oriuzor was no exception. And yet, as we gathered with villagers—elders, parents, young people—we didn’t encounter resistance. We encountered readiness. Readiness to listen. To ask hard questions. To unlearn. And slowly, to speak.",
        "Our team facilitated open discussions in the local dialect, grounding global issues in local reality. We didn’t come as outsiders to instruct, but as partners in dialogue. We shared survivor-centered messages: that seeking help is not shameful, that silence protects no one, and that every woman and girl deserves to feel safe in her own home and community.",
        "What stood out most wasn’t just the willingness to engage—it was the depth of it. Men asked how they could better support their wives and daughters. Mothers, some emotional, shared how fear had shaped their own girlhoods. Young women stepped forward with curiosity and conviction. There was laughter, tension, release—and above all, hope.",
        "These are the moments that defy statistics. Because change isn’t always loud. It doesn’t always wear a badge or arrive with a speech. Sometimes it begins in small village squares, where people gather under a tree to talk about what was once unspeakable.",
        "And that’s exactly what Oriuzor did. They talked. They listened. They began to see. We didn’t just witness a sensitization session—we witnessed a shift. A reawakening. And maybe, just maybe, the beginning of a new tradition—where protection replaces silence, and healing begins where harm once hid.",
      ],
      conclusion:
        "HerRise Foundation will continue to walk alongside communities like Oriuzor. Because the future we fight for—one free of violence, stigma, and fear—will be built not only in city halls or conference rooms, but in the quiet bravery of villages finding their voice",

Right there, in the palace, the conversation expanded to include women who are often unheard in spaces of power.",
